                <h3>Import Prices</h3>

                <br /><br />
                <p>Product price import tool allow you to update product prices or create a new set. The best practice to upload a product list
                is to export price list and update in Excel or another Spreadsheet application. Current release is supporting only CSV files.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>Here is a CSV sample file:</p>
                <pre>"0204123107060","Mediocre Paper Car","440.42","2020-01-24","2020-02-18","General Catalog"
                "3820935109886","Rustic Concrete Shoes","115.64","2020-01-14","2020-02-08","General Catalog"
                "3097516195730","Intelligent Granite Pants","35.3","2020-02-01","2020-02-16","General Catalog"
                "0745446951850","Aerodynamic Copper Gloves","100.13","2020-01-17","2020-02-11","General Catalog"
                "0485426585315","Awesome Steel Coat","286.83","2020-02-03","2020-02-28","General Catalog"
                </pre>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                You may only update amounts in this CSV. While uploading the file, you need to select targeting price group and end date for pricing.
                If selected product has an available pricing perioad, the system will end it and update the period with new amount. If there is no any period, it will create a new one.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                <p>The upload tool updates only created products. It does not create or update any product. So here is the second useful sample CSV file.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <pre>"0204123107060","","140.42","","",""
                "3820935109886","","140.42","","",""
                "3097516195730","","140.42","","",""
                </pre>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                All you need is to enter SKU in the first column and price in the second column. The other columns are not necessary.</p>
