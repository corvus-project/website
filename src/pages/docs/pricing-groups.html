                <br /><br />
                <p>
                Pricing Groups are the heart of the pricing wizard in Corvus. You may create custom groups to targeting a customer list or individual needs.
                Each group can be set a time period including a start and end date. These are customizable settings for each product. After defining pricing groups,
                you may assign a group to a customer. So the customer will order a product from assigned pricing group. You may categorize your customer based on price list.

                <p>Each product will have a different price calculation based on a time period. You may report the price changes in a historical view.</p>
